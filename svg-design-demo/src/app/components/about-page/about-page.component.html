    <p>
        Thank you for agreeing to be among the first to test out our new website, LightScreen.art! Although we’ve made a lot of progress over the past year, we have lots more to do as we move towards our planned September launch on Kickstarter. Your feedback on our website and our product will help us to make our best possible offering.

        Lightscreens give people the look and the privacy of custom stained glass at a fraction of the cost. Users design their lightscreen to their dimensions and colors on our website from our growing collection of templates. We bring the user’s design to life with laser cut colored acrylic sheets embedded in 3D printed frames. The below is intended to provide a description of the design process, tell you what’s working and what’s yet to be fixed or added. When you’ve completed your design, we’ll ask you to answer a brief survey to help us improve the design experience. When you receive your completed lightscreen, we’ll ask you to install it and take a few pictures for our marketing efforts. We’ll ask you to complete another brief survey to help us improve our product. For all that, you get to keep your lightscreen with our compliments and our sincere gratitude.

        Lightscreen design on LightScreen.art is a seven part process. Here’s what we think you should know going in:
    </p>

    <h3>Signup</h3>
    <p>
        We ask you to signup to LIghtScreen.art and remain logged in when working on your lightscreen so we’ll be able to reach you at the email address that you provide. We'll ask for your feedback on this process. Was it easy? Do you feel as though it’s safe and secure? How can we make it better?
    </p>
    <h3>Step One</h3>
    <p>
        This introductory step is very brief. The text is intended to provide the user with enough information to convince them to start the actual design process. There’s an embedded slide show with pictures of the lightscreens we’ve produced and installed thus far. We really want to know if the text does its job— if it convinces the user to click the start button. The slide show is functional but our collection of pictures is far from complete and not as compelling as it needs to be. Pictures of your installed lightscreen will help us to make the images more compelling than they are now.
    </p>
    <h3>Step Two</h3>
    <p>
        This step asks two questions necessary for us to start the design process. This step is fully functional but we believe that improvements can be made to its look and feel. Your feedback on the usability of this page will be really helpful as we move towards our launch.
    </p>
    <h3>Step Three</h3>
    <p>
        This step is probably the hardest part of the whole process because it requires the user to provide us with detailed and accurate measurements of the window they intend to cover. We believe that this step provides the greatest risk to us both in terms of losing a customer and delivering a product that doesn’t fit their window. To that end, we’ve worked to make this as easy as possible and have provided a brief tutorial on how to accurately measure a window. This step is nearly complete, the last major thing we need to implement is a means of accommodating double hung windows that have a lock or locks on the top of the bottom sash— they get in the way of the lightscreen affixed to the window pane in the upper sash. If your window has a lock that may obstruct the installation of your lightscreen, please reach out so we can get measurements to manually account for this. Your feedback on the step and the accompanying tutorial will be really helpful.
    </p>
    <h3>Step Four</h3>
    <p>
        In this step the user is to select a template from which to design their custom lightscreen. There’s still a fair bit of work to be done on this step both in terms of functionality and content. Today, when the user clicks any of the three collection buttons, a gallery appears that contains all the templates that fit their window shape regardless of the template collection they selected. As we move towards launch, we’ll implement a feature that will filter fitting templates to the collection that the user selected. The buttons, which are today identical, will be replaced with buttons that have on them a picture that represents the genre. Right now, our content is very limited. Our templates are made from panels so, for instance, if the user has a window like a transom that’s three feet long and one foot high, the template would be built from four related panels each of which is one foot square. We call these related panels a panel group. At present, we have only around twenty panel groups, none of which were designed by actual professional artists. As we move towards launch, we plan to at least double the number of panel groups and have them designed by professionals. Your feedback on the functionality of this step and the quality of the designs will be really helpful. Your feedback on what sorts of other genres we should support with panel groups will be just as helpful.
    </p>
    <h3>Step Five</h3>
    <p>
        This step is the heart of the whole process and is intended to be the most fun for the user. In this step, the user is to color in the panes of their design by selecting from our color palette. The experience is intended to be a lot like a coloring book or a paint by numbers kit. Right now we’re at the coloring book stage: the user must individually color in every pane in their design. A single design can easily have dozens of panes making the process sometimes a little tedious— all those panes can be kind of a pain. To address this, we plan to implement an autofill feature such that when a user colors in a single pane, all other similar panes in the design are automatically made that same color. Our designers will decide which panes are similar making it a lot like a paint by numbers set. When using autofill, the user will still have the option to color in panes individually. The color palette corresponds to the colors of acrylic sheets we have available and is likely to change as we move towards launch. We’ll have lots of questions on this step: Was it fun? Was it intuitive? Are we missing any colors? What would make it better?
    </p>
    <h3>Step Six</h3>
    <p>
        This is the confirmation step similar to a shopping cart on an e-commerce site. We display the user’s complete custom lightscreen with their dimensions and their color selection so they can double check their design. Even more, the intent of this step is to cause the user to love their design to the point that they’ll pay money to see it in real life on their chosen window.
    </p>
    <h3>Step Seven</h3>
    <p>
        This is the checkout step. Today, we only support a coupon code and don’t support credit cards. The coupon code for this phase of our testing is “lightscreen.art-beta” (don’t type the quotes). Like the sign up step, we'll ask for your feedback on this process, was it easy? Do you feel as though it’s safe and secure? How can we make it better?
    </p>
    <p>
        Again, your lightscreen is yours to keep, it’s our way of saying thanks for your effort and your feedback. We’ll do all we can to get your lightscreen produced and delivered quickly but may be delayed— our inventory of acrylic sheets is very limited as is our number of 3D printers— it’s more of a printer garden than a printer farm. There’ll be more questions from us when you receive your lightscreen mostly centered on “Would you put this in your home?” and “If so, what would you pay for it?” If, after all this feedback, we think we have a viable commercial offering, we’ll take the huge step of launching on Kickstarter. You’re an indispensable part of this process and we appreciate your help!

    <h1 id="measurementInfo">Measurement Tutorial</h1>
    <h3>Here are some tricks to ensure accurate measurements for your Lightscreen!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>
            Measurements taken should refer to the actual glass of your window (the part to be covered) and should not include any part of the frame, sill, or encasement
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Windows with dividers should be measured as one total window - just make sure to get an accurate divider width
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            From your window dimensions, the number of dividers and the divider width, we’ll compute the dimensions of each panel to fit inside of the dividers. The computed panel dimensions will be displayed at the confirmation step, we suggest that you check our panel dimensions against your actual measurements of the glass between your dividers.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Using a flexible measuring tape can help get a more precise measurement. If you have a stiff tape measurer, you can get the most accurate measurement by bending the tape at a 90 degree angle and getting as close to the edge of the glass as possible.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            If your measurements are more precise than a sixteenth of an inch or whole millimeters, round down. Decimals are welcome if you’ve chosen to measure in inches!
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            For double hung windows, take measurements for each sash separately
        </p></li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="installationInfo">Installation Instructions</h1>
    <h3>Installing your lightscreen is easier than most other window coverings - no need for permanent holes or messy water.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>
            Begin by unpacking all of your panels and laying them out in the order you designed. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Use this time to make sure everything looks right.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Starting with one of the lower corners of your lightscreen, remove the tape backing and line up your panel with the corresponding corner of your window. Take your time and ensure this panel is level and flush with the frame of your window, as any error sat this step will accumulate as more panels are added
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Push firmly for 10 seconds. If your lightscreen shifts during this process, you may gently remove it and restart.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Repeat this process with the next panel in the row, ensuring it is flush with both the frame and adjacent panels. 
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            When starting a new row, make sure the corners of your panels line up square with those below them. Avoid leaving gaps that are large enough to let in light!
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
            Repeat this process until your entire Lightscreen is installed.
        </p></li>
    </ol>
