# 3DPrintingProject
This repo contains the files/scripts used for STL file generation from SVG as well as any other related programs/scripts. The frameGeneration.scad
file is used for the actual frame generation. For regular use (unless you want to play around with the frame generation), you can just include
the frameGeneration.scad file in a different scad file: follow the format of extrusionTest.scad to use the frame generator.
